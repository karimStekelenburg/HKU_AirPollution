## Servo Mapping
In order to have individual control over each motor, we'll need to define of some kind of co√∂rdination system. Since we will have only nine motors, this can be as simple as the following:

## Class diagram
Great! We have labeled all the motors! Now we can think of software architecture. Below a class diagram is shown with a graphical (UML) representation of the classes we'll use to control this badboy.

### Human explanation
#### The Steppa class
This is the class we will use to control a single stepper motor. It knows about the pins it's wired to and can be used to set the motor to a certain speed.

#### The Controller class
We will use this class for easier control over all motors together.
